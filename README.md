*Heatwave and Air Quality Prediction Model*

This project aims to build a machine learning model for predicting heatwaves and air quality index (AQI) in specific regions. The goal of the model is to provide reliable and accurate predictions on a monthly basis, so that authorities and individuals can take proactive measures to protect themselves and their communities.

**Data Collection**

The data used to train and evaluate the model was collected from various sources such as meteorological agencies, air quality monitoring networks, and government organizations. The data included temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, and air pollution levels for regions Adilabad, Nizamabad, Warangal, Karimnagar and Khammam for at least few years. The data was collected and cleaned to ensure that it was in a format that could be used to train the model.

**Feature Engineering**

The next step was to carefully select the features or variables that will be used to train the model. These features should be relevant to the task of predicting heatwaves and AQI, and should take into account the specific regions and months that we want to make predictions for. The following features were selected after careful analysis:

- Mean temperature
- Maximum temperature
- Minimum temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Solar Radiation
- Air pollution levels (NOx, SO2, PM2.5 and PM10)

**Model Selection**

Different types of machine learning models were compared, such as linear regression, Random Forest, and neural networks, and the Random Forest model was found to perform the best. The model was then trained and fine-tuned to improve its performance.

**Evaluation**

The model was evaluated using a test dataset that was separate from the training dataset. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The model was found to have an accuracy of around 80%, which is considered to be good.

**Conclusion**

This project presents a valuable tool for predicting heatwaves and AQI in specific regions using machine learning techniques. However, it's worth noting that predicting weather and air quality is a challenging task, and the model should be used as part of a broader approach that also includes expert knowledge and monitoring. The model is still under development and is not yet fully tested or validated, but we are confident that it has the potential to be a valuable resource for those working to address the impacts of climate change and protect public health and the environment.
